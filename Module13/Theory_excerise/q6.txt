Explain how conditional statements work in PHP?
answer:
If we want to execute some code if a condition is true and another code if a condition is false, use 
the if....else statement
• PHP If & ElseIf Statements
• If we want to execute some code if one of several conditions are true use the elseif statement
• Syntax:
if (condition)
    code to be executed if condition is true;       
elseif(condition)
    code to be executed if condition is true;
else
    code to be executed if condition is false
