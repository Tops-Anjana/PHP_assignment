q3: Explain the concept of variables in php?
Answer:
1. Syntax:A variable in PHP is defined by a dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name.The name can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but it cannot start with a number.

$variableName = "Hello, World!";

2. Variable names are case-sensitive. $variable, $Variable, and $VARIABLE would be considered three different variables.
