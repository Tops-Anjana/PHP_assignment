Ques 7: Discuss the difference between for loop, foreach loop, and do-while loop in PHP

for loop:
A for loop is generally used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code. It requires an initial condition, a loop condition, and an increment (or decrement) statement.
syntax:
for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){
    body of the loop;
}

for each loop:-
1. The for each loop is used to loop through arrays.
2. For every loop, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value (and
the array pointer is moved by one) -so on the next loop, you'll be looking at the
next element.
Syntax
foreach(array as value){
code to be executed;
}

do.. while loop:-
The do...while loop will execute a block of code at least once-it then will
repeat the loop as long as a condition is true.
Syntax:
do{
code to be executed;
} while (condition);

while loop:-
The while loop will execute a block of code if and as long as a
condition is true.
Syntax
while (condition)
code to be executed;
